<h1>Welcome on the Hide and Seek recode repository!</h1>


The idea behind this project is to re-create a now defunct gamemode created by the also defunct HiveMC
<p>
(Note to Hive Games owners: the maps listed in the "config" file are only for test purpose and not distributed within this repository.)

<h2>Notice: This version of the code does not include a config.yml file where you can add your own maps and customise things. This will follow when the game will be fully functionnal</h2>
